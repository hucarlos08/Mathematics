# Mathematics

This repository contains educational materials and lessons designed for the Mathematics course in the Geomatics specialization program at CentroGeo. It covers a range of topics, from fundamental concepts to advanced topics like derivatives, linear regression, optimization, and probability.

## Repository Structure

- **`Lessons/`**: Main folder containing subdirectories organized by topic:
  - **`Basics/`**: Fundamental mathematical concepts, such as algebra and geometry.
  - **`Derivatives/`**: Lessons on derivatives and their applications.
  - **`Linear_Regression/`**: Introduction to linear regression and its implementation.
  - **`Optimization/`**: Lessons on optimization methods, such as gradient descent.
  - **`Probability/`**: Key concepts in probability and statistics.
- **`Plot_Python.ipynb`**: An interactive Jupyter notebook for exploring mathematical plots using Python.
- **`LICENSE`**: MIT license governing the usage of this repository's content.
- **`README.md`**: This document, serving as an introduction and guide.

## Requirements

To use the Jupyter notebooks, ensure that you have Python and Jupyter installed in your environment. Follow these steps:

1. Install Python if it's not already installed on your system.
2. Install the required dependencies by running:
   ```bash
   pip install jupyter
   ```

## How to Use This Repository with Google Colab

If you prefer to run the Jupyter notebooks directly in the cloud using Google Colab, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the notebook you want to use on GitHub (e.g., [`Plot_Python.ipynb`](https://github.com/hucarlos08/Mathematics/blob/main/Plot_Python.ipynb)).
2. Open the notebook in Google Colab by modifying the URL:
   - Replace `github.com` in the URL with `colab.research.google.com/github`.  
     For example:  
     ```
     https://github.com/hucarlos08/Mathematics/blob/main/Plot_Python.ipynb
     ```
     becomes  
     ```
     https://colab.research.google.com/github/hucarlos08/Mathematics/blob/main/Plot_Python.ipynb
     ```
3. Once the notebook opens in Colab, click the **Run All** button to execute all cells.
4. If the notebook requires files from the repository, clone the repository within the Colab environment by running this command in a code cell:
   ```python
   !git clone https://github.com/hucarlos08/Mathematics.git
   ```

Now you can interact with the notebooks directly in Google Colab without setting up Python locally.
